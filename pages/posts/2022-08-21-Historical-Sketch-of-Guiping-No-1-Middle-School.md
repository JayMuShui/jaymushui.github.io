~~编辑于2022年暑假，今天网上冲浪的时候无意间看到了一中的老照片，突然心血来潮想写一篇关于一中的历史介绍。百年府学，红色一中，作为咱们时常挂在嘴边的话，或多或少都知道一部分历史，但并不完整，所以以此篇文章，为咱们补一下历史，也为新生们提前普及一下~ 本文内有一部分摘抄，在结尾会注明出处。~~

在学校的宣传栏和网络零零散散的文章中了解到一些一中的历史，时桂平一中学生社区运营，为了吸引新生的关注以及后来用于校庆时社团的社报宣传，故摘抄拼凑了这篇文字，内容出处将标注在文末，现在主要是为了存档，做了一些删改和符合Markdown样式的转写。

1907年，桂平浔阳书院劝学所所长陆显书，倡立桂平中学堂预备科。  

1908年，此倡议得到批准，办学教育经费以桂平县合邑宾兴田租解决，**桂平中学堂**正式成立，这就是现在桂平市第一中学的前身。 同时期桂平创办有 **桂平小学堂(桂平西山镇中心校前身)**  、**浔郡中学堂(桂平浔州高中前身)**

>Background: In 1905 (31st year of Guangxu), China's nearly 1,300-year-old imperial examination system came to an end, leading to the rise of new-style schools across the country.
>[Imperial examination#Decline and abolition - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination#Decline_and_abolition)

In 1907, Lu Xianshu, Director of the Xunyang Academy's Education Promotion Office in Guiping, proposed establishing a preparatory department for Guiping Middle School.

In 1908, this proposal was approved. Educational funding was secured through the combined county's Binxing field rent, and **Guiping Middle School**`桂平中学堂` was officially established, becoming the predecessor of today's Guiping No.1 Middle School. During the same period, **Guiping Primary School**`桂平小学堂` (predecessor of Guiping Xishan Town Central School`桂平西山镇中心校`) and **Xunjun Middle School**`浔郡中学堂` (predecessor of Guiping Xunzhou Senior High School`浔州高级中学`) were also established.

![Xunjun Middle School](https://cloudflare-imgbed-telegraph.pages.dev/file/c41b1148a664df8748e67.jpg)_Stone tablet of Xunjun Middle School`浔郡中学堂碑` (predecessor of Xunzhou Senior High School`浔州高中`, equivalent to the old campus) Now designated as a key cultural heritage site of Guiping City

>The school implemented a five-year curriculum system, offering courses in moral education, classical studies, Chinese literature, English, history, geography, mathematics, natural history, physics, chemistry, legal studies, financial management, drawing, music, and physical education. Admission and promotion were based on examination results, with selective enrollment and grade retention for those who failed promotion exams.

>The first class admitted 50 students, with classes held at the [Xunyang Academy](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B5%94%E9%98%B3%E4%B9%A6%E9%99%A2)`浔阳书院` (current site of the municipal government). In subsequent years, the Guiyi Academy`桂邑书院`, Wenchang Palace`文昌宫`, and County Education Office were converted into school buildings (current sites of the Public Security Bureau and Workers' Cultural Palace).

**In 1912, the Qing Dynasty fell and the Republic of China was established**, and the school was renamed Guiping County Junior Middle School`桂平县立初级中学校`.

### 桂平县立一中时期 (革命火星、国共内战·1925-1933) {lang="zh-CN"}

### Guiping County No.1 Middle School Period (Revolutionary Sparks, Nationalist-Communist Civil War·1925-1933) {lang="en"}

::: zh-CN

1925年，东区的乡绅薛扬波、程修鲁截留合邑宾兴田租的四分之三，在寻旺办东区初中,相当于使用了桂平县立初级中学校的办学经费，因此造成学校难以维持正常教学，被迫停办。县内各界纷纷抗争。 

1926年在民情民意压力下，最后底合邑宾兴田租收归教育局代管协调。 

1927年春，有了各界支持，资金支持，桂平县立初级中学校重新复课，并改名为桂平县立一中，而寻旺的东区初中也收改为县办，称桂平县立二中。

In 1925, local gentry Xue Yangbo and Cheng Xiulu from the eastern district diverted three-quarters of the combined county's Binxing field rent to establish an eastern district junior middle school in Xunwang, effectively using the operating funds of Guiping County Junior Middle School`桂平县立初级中学校`. This led to the school's inability to maintain normal operations and forced closure. Various sectors of the county protested against this action.

In 1926, under pressure from public opinion, the combined county's Binxing field rent was finally placed under the management and coordination of the Education Bureau.

In the spring of 1927, with support from various sectors and financial backing, Guiping County Junior Middle School`桂平县立初级中学校` resumed classes and was renamed Guiping County No.1 Middle School`桂平县立一中`. The eastern district junior middle school in Xunwang was also taken over by the county and renamed Guiping County No.2 Middle School`桂平县立二中`.

### Period of Merger and Educational Chaos (Nationalist-Communist Civil War, Anti-Japanese War·1934-1945) {lang="en"}

***该段历史存在争议，仅供参考***

>背景:1930年，武宣人陈承材在城厢倡办私立正心初中。  

1933年，县教育办学机构改革中，**桂平县立二中**，**私立正心初中**并入桂平县立一中，学校由此改名为**桂平县立初级中学**。 1934年，桂平县立初级中学又并入 **省立八中(浔州高中前身)** ，合称省立浔州中学。  

由此，桂平一中独立办学的历史暂停近十年。 

1943年，省立八中再度分出初中，恢复 **桂平县立初级中学**。 

![50~60](https://cloudflare-imgbed-telegraph.pages.dev/file/f3815ea57f7f4e8da7cf9.png)

>背景:1935年(我校与省立八中合并次年)，在桂平西郊的桂山(西山)成立了一所新的中学(现西山路乳泉酒业处)**桂平县国民中学**，原是更早期的蚕业学堂，当时桂系执政广西时，为实施其"行新政，用新人"的政策，而创立的一种独别于全国学制的中学，修业四年。是直接为李、白桂系培养基层人才的学校，在上世纪40年代，桂平县内相当一部分乡村干部和小学教师出自国民中学。  

>↑1928年在莫斯科召开的中共六大会议中广西唯一代表的桂平籍胡福田（烈士）就曾在蚕业学堂上学一年。

1943年，刚刚分离出来的桂平县立初级中学学生，搬到桂山上课，由两年制改为三年制。 两校共处一地上课，校舍不足。人数较少的县国民中学则让出校舍，另设分校接纳未毕业的国中学生班级，到寻旺中心校借校舍上课，就此不再招新生，缩减三班为两班直到1946年毕业。
_就此县国民中学自动退出了历史舞台。 实际上1943年开始在桂山上课的，就全部是桂平县立初级中学学生。_

1942~1944年间，县府拔款建校舍，在桂山上课的一中扩大招生，最多时达24班，学生1400多人，成为当时广西省内在校学生最多的初级中学

1944年秋，抗战局势影响，日军压境，桂平沦陷，桂平县立初级中学只得迁到罗秀旧地山（旧地名），借姚氏宗祠上课，这也是桂平沦陷期间， 桂平县内唯一一所能正常上课的中学，其他中学均停课疏散。

_注:这一段历史也有观点认为，早期的桂平一中因中间撤并入省立八中近十年就算是不存在了，而如今的桂平一中则应始于1935年，从八中分出来承接桂平县国民中学的。_

***This period of history is subject to debate, for reference only***

>Background: In 1930, Chen Chengcai from Wuxuan initiated the establishment of a private Zhengxin Junior Middle School`私立正心初中` in the city.

In 1933, during the county's educational institution reform, **Guiping County No.2 Middle School**`桂平县立二中` and **Private Zhengxin Junior Middle School**`私立正心初中` were merged into Guiping County No.1 Middle School, and the school was renamed **Guiping County Junior Middle School**`桂平县立初级中学`. In 1934, Guiping County Junior Middle School was merged into **Provincial No.8 Middle School**`省立八中` (predecessor of Xunzhou Senior High School`浔州高中`), forming Provincial Xunzhou Middle School`省立浔州中学`.

Thus, Guiping No.1 Middle School's independent operation was suspended for nearly a decade.

In 1943, Provincial No.8 Middle School separated its junior middle school section again, restoring **Guiping County Junior Middle School**`桂平县立初级中学`.


![50~60](https://cloudflare-imgbed-telegraph.pages.dev/file/f3815ea57f7f4e8da7cf9.png)

>Background: In 1935 (the year after our school's merger with Provincial No.8 Middle School), a new middle school was established in Guishan (Xishan) in western Guiping (current location of Ruquan Winery on Xishan Road) - **Guiping County National Middle School**`桂平县国民中学`. Originally an earlier sericulture school, it was established by the Guangxi Clique during their governance of Guangxi to implement their "New Policies, New People" policy. This was a unique four-year middle school system different from the national education system, directly training grassroots personnel for the Li-Bai Guangxi Clique. In the 1940s, a significant portion of rural cadres and primary school teachers in Guiping County graduated from this National Middle School.

>↑Hu Futian (1896-1928.12), the only representative from Guangxi at the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party held in Moscow in 1928, had studied at the sericulture school for one year.
>Hu Futian (1896-1928.12)[Chinese Baidu Wiki](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%83%A1%E7%A6%8F%E7%94%B0/6120289)


![Hu Futian](https://cloudflare-imgbed-telegraph.pages.dev/file/5ee97a9b2c9f8b0131908.png)_Hu Futian (1896-1928.12)_

In 1943, the newly separated Guiping County Junior Middle School students moved to Guishan for classes, changing from a two-year to a three-year system. The two schools shared the same location, facing insufficient classroom space. The smaller National Middle School gave up its buildings and established a branch school to accommodate its unfinished classes, using classrooms at Xunwang Central School. It stopped admitting new students and reduced from three classes to two until graduation in 1946.
_Thus, the County National Middle School quietly exited the historical stage. In fact, from 1943 onwards, all students studying at Guishan were from Guiping County Junior Middle School._

Between 1942 and 1944, the county government allocated funds to build school buildings. The No.1 Middle School at Guishan expanded its enrollment, reaching a maximum of 24 classes with over 1,400 students, becoming the junior middle school with the largest student population in Guangxi Province at that time.

In the autumn of 1944, due to the war situation and Japanese forces approaching, Guiping fell to enemy occupation. Guiping County Junior Middle School had to relocate to Luoxiu Old Mountain (an old place name), using the Yao Family Ancestral Hall for classes. This was the only middle school in Guiping County that could maintain normal operations during the occupation period, while other middle schools had suspended classes and evacuated.

_Note: Some historical perspectives suggest that the early Guiping No.1 Middle School effectively ceased to exist after its decade-long merger with Provincial No.8 Middle School, and that the current Guiping No.1 Middle School should be considered to have originated in 1935, when it separated from No.8 Middle School to take over the Guiping County National Middle School._

On January 1, 1950, the Guiping People's Government was established and took over the county's educational affairs. Middle schools in both urban and rural areas resumed classes one after another.
Guiping County No.1 Junior Middle School moved from Guishan to County Government Street (current location of the Central School) and began implementing the "3-3" system (three years of junior middle school and three years of senior middle school).

Before 1953, middle schools began implementing socialist education based on Soviet experience.

In the second semester of 1953, the Ministry of Education issued the "Directive on Taking Over Private Primary and Secondary Schools." Following this directive, Guiping County merged **Private Xungui Junior Middle School**`私立浔桂初中` into Guiping No.1 Middle School (founded by local gentry Li Xiaocen in 1941).

In 1956, Guiping County adjusted its middle school layout, adding four schools in the four major districts (east, south, west, and north): No.3 Middle School (Shepo), No.4 Middle School (Dayang), No.5 Middle School (Baisha), and No.6 Middle School (Jintian), bringing the total number of middle schools in the county to eight. **Guiping No.1 Middle School moved to its current location at 146 Chengdong Street, while Xunzhou Senior High School moved from the original No.1 Middle School site to its current location.**

>Background: In 1969, the "Cultural Revolution" was launched. This movement was exploited by reactionary elements, leading to a series of events. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, related content will not be elaborated here.

Against this backdrop, Guiping County No.1 Junior Middle School was at times renamed: Workers and Peasants Middle School, People's Middle School, and, until the end of this tumultuous and frenzied era, the school was known as Guiping Town Middle School.

In 1968, Guiping County No.1 Middle School was designated as a complete junior middle school (offering only junior middle school education).

In 1969, Guiping County No.1 Junior Middle School began to add senior high school classes again.

In 1970, Guiping Town Middle School established a branch campus in Luocong, 35 kilometers from the county seat, moving the senior high school section to run a farm. Each year, one grade of senior high school students was sent to board there, combining study with labor, cultivating over 100 mu (about 16.5 acres) of sugarcane. The Luocong branch was not abolished until 1979, at which point its buildings and farmland were transferred to Baisha Luocong Junior Middle School. This period is now depicted in the "Luocong Years" mural at the entrance of No.1 Middle School. At the branch, students both studied and worked, and the main campus was also active: first in Yongpei, then in Lingtou, it took over farmland from the former Huangcun Labor Reform Farm, totaling 190 mu (about 31 acres), until 1986 when the Lingtou farm was transferred to the County Vocational Middle School.

In 1976, under the correct leadership of the Party, everything returned to normal, and the school resumed regular education, enrolling both junior and senior high school students.

Between 1981 and 1982, due to the severe decline in the national average cultural level, a large population struggled to meet job requirements in the 1980s. As a result, **agricultural secondary classes** and **vocational secondary classes** were established at Guiping No.1 Middle School.  

In 1983, Guiping County decided to establish an additional junior high school in the urban area. Consequently, Guiping Town Middle School was renamed **Guiping County No.1 Middle School**, and the newly established junior high school became the current **Guiping No.2 Middle School** in Chengnan.

1994年，桂平撤县改市，成为广西第四个代管县级市， 

1996年10月由玉林地区改为刚刚成立的地级市贵港市代管，所有单位都得改名，桂平县第一中学也就改为桂平市第一中学，此后继续着在桂平教育树人的重任。 

约2001年前后，随着"贵港市示范高中"的名誉确立，桂平一中也就进入了历史上最大的改革时期，取消初中，停止初中招生，由此，有着近百年初中教育史的桂平一中，成为一所完全高中。 

2001年7月被自治区教育厅批准为"广西壮族自治区第一批示范性普通高中立项建设学校"。  

2005年学校被确定为第三批"广西示范性普通高中"，并于2012年通过自治区示范性普通高中复查验收。

In 1994, Guiping was upgraded from a county to a county-level city, becoming the fourth county-level city under the administration of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In China's administrative system, a "county" (县) is a lower-level administrative division than a "city" (市). When a county is upgraded to a city, it becomes a "county-level city" (县级市), which maintains the same administrative level but gains certain urban privileges.

In October 1996, with the establishment of the prefecture-level city of Guigang`贵港市`, Guiping was transferred from Yulin Prefecture to Guigang's administration. All institutions were required to update their names, and thus Guiping County No.1 Middle School`桂平县第一中学` was renamed Guiping (City) No.1 Middle School`桂平市第一中学`, continuing its mission of education in Guiping.

Around 2001, with the establishment of its reputation as a **Guigang City Model Senior High School**, Guiping No.1 Middle School entered its largest historical reform period: it discontinued junior high school education and halted junior high admissions. Thus, after nearly a century of junior high education, the school transformed into a **full-fledged senior high school**.  

In July 2001, it was approved by the **Autonomous Region Department of Education** as one of the "First Batch of Projected Model Senior High Schools in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region."  

In 2005, the school was designated as a **Third Batch Guangxi Model Senior High School** and successfully passed the autonomous region’s re-inspection and acceptance in 2012.
